        <p>This page is completely open source, and the code and files are available for ALL to download.
            I, Carlie, created a mini website for anyone to practise on, change, adapt, edit and style 
            in any which way they desire, with the hopes this can be a place for those who are beginning 
            with coding to come and have a go at some real live code.</br> 
            This page and its files can be found on GitHub, an AMAZING resource for programmers and coders
            to come together and collaborate on projects together, receive tips and advice and swap code.
